Are you wondering how many views you’ll need to get paid on YouTube? If so, you’re in the right place.
Today I have an awesome guest post from Ryan Scribner who earns $20,000+ per MONTH in just ad revenue from his YouTube channel!
Isn’t that crazy? I think it’s amazing that we can earn that kind of money on YouTube.
To understand how many views you’ll need to get paid on YouTube you must first understand YouTube’s earning rules.

## YouTube Earning Requirements:
* Minimum of 1,000 subscribers
* 4,000 hours of viewing time in the past year
* Before any ads appear, the videos will go through a standard process including automated or human reviews to see if it meets their guidelines (Ryan covers this in more detail below)
